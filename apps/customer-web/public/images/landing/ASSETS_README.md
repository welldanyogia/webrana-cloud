## Image Optimization Guidelines

### Recommended Tools
- **Squoosh** (https://squoosh.app) - Browser-based, excellent quality
- **ImageOptim** (Mac) - Batch optimization
- **Sharp** (Node.js) - Programmatic conversion

### Optimization Steps

1. **Resize to target dimensions**
   - Hero: 1920x1080px
   - Features: 800x600px  
   - Why Us: 1200x800px
   - Pattern: 400x400px

2. **Convert to WebP**
   ```bash
   # Using sharp-cli
   npx sharp-cli -i input.jpg -o output.webp --format webp --quality 85
   ```

3. **Compress further if needed**
   - Target < 200KB for large images
   - Target < 100KB for feature images
   - Target < 50KB for patterns

4. **Generate fallback JPG/PNG**
   - For older browser support
   - Use `<picture>` element with sources

### Code Implementation

```tsx
// Using Next.js Image component with WebP + fallback
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/images/landing/hero-dashboard.webp"
  alt="Modern cloud infrastructure dashboard"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  priority
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
/>
```

```html
<!-- Using picture element for format fallback -->
<picture>
  <source srcset="/images/landing/hero-dashboard.webp" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="/images/landing/hero-dashboard.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
  <img src="/images/landing/hero-dashboard.jpg" alt="..." />
</picture>
```
